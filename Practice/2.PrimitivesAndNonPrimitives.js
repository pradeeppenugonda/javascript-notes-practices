/* 

In JavaScript, primitives and non-primitives are two categories of data types. Here's a breakdown:

Primitives
----------
        Primitives are the most basic data types in JavaScript. 
        They are immutable (cannot be changed) and are stored directly in the memory.

    Types of Primitives:
        String: Represents textual data.
        
        Number: Represents numeric values (both integers and floating-point numbers).
        
        Boolean: Represents logical values (true or false).
        
        Undefined: A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
        
        Null: Represents the intentional absence of any value.
        
        Symbol: Represents a unique and immutable value, often used as object keys.
        
        BigInt: Represents large integers beyond the safe limit of Number.
        
    Key Characteristics of Primitives:
        Stored by value.
        Immutable (e.g., modifying a string creates a new string).


Non-Primitives
--------------
        Non-primitives are more complex data types. 
        They are mutable (can be changed) and are stored by reference.

    Types of Non-Primitives:

        Objects: A collection of key-value pairs.

        Arrays: Ordered collections of values.
        
        Functions: Blocks of reusable code.

        Other Objects: Includes special objects like Date, RegExp, etc.

    Key Characteristics of Non-Primitives:
        Stored by reference.
        Mutable (e.g., modifying an object changes the original object).

        Key Differences Between Primitives and Non-Primitives
        --------------------------------------------------------
        Feature	        Primitives	        Non-Primitives
        --------------------------------------------------------
        Storage	        Stored by value	    Stored by reference
        Mutability	    Immutable	        Mutable
        --------------------------------------------------------

        Examples	String, Number, Boolean	Object, Array, Function
    Would you like me to demonstrate these concepts with code examples?


Primitives in JavaScript are data types that represent a single value and are immutable. These include:

- `String`
- `Number`
- `Boolean`
- `Undefined`
- `Null`
- `Symbol`
- `BigInt`

Non-primitives (or reference types) are objects that can store multiple values and are mutable. These include:

- `Object`
- `Array`
- `Function`

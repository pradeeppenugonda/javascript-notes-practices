/* 
    "undefined" is a place holder for the variable once we declare the variable

        when we assign the value to it it will store that value. 

    JS is a loosly typed language as we can assign any value to it even after assigned earlier. 

    "not defined" means .. we have not even declared the value and we want to access it.
